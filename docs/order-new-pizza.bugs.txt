Title:       Name field should be Mandatory

Title:       Number of orders should be restricted
Description: Currently, the system allows you to create as many Orders as possible. It makes sense to restrict the
             number of open Orders. 
             If an user tries to create more than a predefined number of orders, System should display an error and possibly
             disable the entire entry Form and present a link to take them to the List of Orders where user can delete
             an Order.

             7. Do this 40 times
             8. One user should have some reasonable limit on New pizza orders. It should not be allowed after the limit is hit unless

Title:       Name Field should be a drop down
Description: The Pizza Name field should not be a free form entry Input box. It should be a drop down from which User can
             make a valid selection. Since the list of pizza types is a limited list of what the Pizzeria offers, it makes
             sense to turn it into a drop down with pre-populated items. This will reduce lots of data entry errors.

             This is not a bug but a feature request.
